**Proof: Constructing the Negative Binomial Distribution Using the Geometric Distribution**

Let us begin by defining the geometric and negative binomial distributions using the notation provided:

1. **Geometric Distribution**: The probability mass function (PMF) is given by
   $p_X(x) = p^x (1 - p)^{x - 1}, \quad x = 1, 2, 3, \dots$
   This represents the number of trials \(x\) needed to achieve the first success, where each trial is independent and has a success probability \(p\).

2. **Negative Binomial Distribution**: The PMF is given by
   $p_X(x) = \binom{x + r - 1}{x} p^r (1 - p)^x, \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \dots$
   This represents the number of failures \(x\) before achieving the \(r\)-th success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability \(p\).

Our goal is to show that the negative binomial distribution can be constructed from the sum of \(r\) independent geometric random variables.

---

**Step 1: Interpret the Geometric Distribution**

First, note that the given PMF for the geometric distribution seems unconventional. Typically, the geometric distribution for the number of failures before the first success is:
$p_X(x) = p (1 - p)^x, \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \dots$
However, the provided PMF suggests counting the number of trials until success, starting from \(x = 1\).

To align with standard definitions, let's consider the geometric distribution as representing the number of failures before a success, with PMF:
$p_{X_i}(x_i) = p (1 - p)^{x_i}, \quad x_i = 0, 1, 2, \dots$
This adjustment allows us to model the number of failures before each success.

---

**Step 2: Define Independent Geometric Random Variables**

Let \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_r\) be independent and identically distributed geometric random variables representing the number of failures before each of the first \(r\) successes. Each \(X_i\) has the PMF:
$p_{X_i}(x_i) = p (1 - p)^{x_i}, \quad x_i = 0, 1, 2, \dots$

---

**Step 3: Sum of Geometric Random Variables**

Let \(X\) be the total number of failures before the \(r\)-th success:
$X = X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_r$
Our objective is to find the distribution of \(X\), which we claim follows the negative binomial distribution.

---

**Step 4: Derive the PMF of \(X\)**

To find the PMF \(p_X(x)\) of \(X\), consider the probability that the total number of failures before the \(r\)-th success is \(x\). This is equivalent to finding the probability that in a sequence of \(x + r\) trials, there are \(x\) failures and \(r\) successes, with the \(r\)-th success occurring on the last trial.

**Combinatorial Argument:**

- **Total Trials**: \(x + r\)
- **Failures**: \(x\)
- **Successes**: \(r\)
- **Condition**: The last trial must be a success (the \(r\)-th success).

**Number of Ways to Arrange the Trials:**

We need to arrange \(x + r - 1\) trials (excluding the last success) with \(x\) failures and \(r - 1\) successes. The number of ways to do this is:
$\binom{x + r - 1}{r - 1}$

**Probability of a Specific Sequence:**

Each specific sequence of failures (F) and successes (S) occurs with probability:
$p^r (1 - p)^x$
since there are \(r\) successes and \(x\) failures.

**Therefore, the PMF of \(X\) is:**
$p_X(x) = \binom{x + r - 1}{r - 1} p^r (1 - p)^x, \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \dots$
This matches the PMF of the negative binomial distribution as given.

---

**Step 5: Conclusion**

We have shown that the sum \(X\) of \(r\) independent geometric random variables \(X_i\), each representing the number of failures before a success, follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters \(r\) and \(p\). Specifically:
$X = X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_r \sim \text{Negative Binomial}(r, p)$
with PMF:
$p_X(x) = \binom{x + r - 1}{r - 1} p^r (1 - p)^x$
Thus, the negative binomial distribution can be rigorously constructed using the geometric distribution.

---

**Note:** The key to this proof is recognizing that the negative binomial distribution models the number of failures before achieving a fixed number of successes in independent Bernoulli trials. By summing independent geometric random variables (each modeling failures before a success), we obtain the negative binomial distribution.
