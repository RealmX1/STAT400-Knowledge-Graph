You'll be given some context regarding the topic {topic} in {chapter_name} of a statistics textbook, and a schema according to which you should model the topic. Create a markdown file for the topic according to the schema, and note down any information unfit for the schema in a separate markdown file. 
Provide additional important information in each part of the schema that isn't inside context using itallic text (*additional information*).
You do not need to fill out all parts of the schema. Leave blank parts that are not provided with context nor have additional important information.
