\section*{Introduction}
We want to prove that the minimum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Geometric random variables is also Geometrically distributed.

Let \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n \) be i.i.d. Geometric random variables with parameter \( p \), which represents the probability of success in each Bernoulli trial. The goal is to show that the minimum of these random variables, 
\[
X_{\text{min}} = \min(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n),
\]
is also Geometrically distributed.

\section*{Proof}
The probability that \( X_{\text{min}} \) is greater than or equal to some integer \( k \) is given by the probability that all \( X_i \) are greater than or equal to \( k \):
\[
P(X_{\text{min}} \geq k) = P(X_1 \geq k) P(X_2 \geq k) \dots P(X_n \geq k).
\]
Since \( X_i \) are i.i.d. Geometric random variables with parameter \( p \),
\[
P(X_i \geq k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
P(X_{\text{min}} \geq k) = \left( (1 - p)^{k - 1} \right)^n = (1 - p)^{n(k - 1)}.
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(X_{\text{min}} = k) \) as follows:
\[
P(X_{\text{min}} = k) = P(X_{\text{min}} \geq k) - P(X_{\text{min}} \geq k + 1).
\]
Substituting the values, we get
\[
P(X_{\text{min}} = k) = (1 - p)^{n(k - 1)} - (1 - p)^{n k}.
\]

Thus, \( X_{\text{min}} \) is also a Geometric random variable with parameter \( p' = 1 - (1 - p)^n \), which completes the proof.
