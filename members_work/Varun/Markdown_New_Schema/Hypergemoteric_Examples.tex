\section{Examples}

\textbf{Examples:} \\
Fix \( N, M, n \in \mathbb{N} \). Suppose we have a population of size \( N \) with exactly \( M \) successes in it. Suppose an experiment involves choosing \( n \) objects from the population (without replacement). Given \( \omega \), an outcome for this experiment, let
\[
X(\omega) := \text{number of successes in } \omega
\]
In this setting, \( X \) is said to have the \textbf{Hypergeometric distribution}.
