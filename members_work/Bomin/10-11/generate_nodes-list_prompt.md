You will be provided with the complete content of a chapter, descriptions of different node types, and the list of existing `node_name:node_type` pairs in the knowledge graph. Based on this information, your task is to generate a list of new `node_name:node_type` pairs that should be added to the knowledge graph for this chapter.

- In no particular order:
  - Read the node type descriptions carefully.
  - Analyze the content of the chapter and consider how different knowledge can be represented as nodes (of various types) in the graph.
  - Ensure that none of the new nodes already exist in the graph by cross-referencing the provided list of existing nodes.
- Finally,
  - present the output as a list of `node_name:node_type` pairs. for each of such node give a very brief description of the node.

**Input:**
- **Node Type Descriptions:**  
  <node_types> 
  </node_types> 
- **Chapter Content:**  
  <context> 
  </context>  
- **Existing `node_name:node_type` Pairs in the Graph:**  
  <existing_nodes> 
  </existing_nodes>

**Output:**  
A list of new `node_name:node_type` pairs to add to the graph for that chapter.
