## Attributes

- **Name**: uniform distribution

- **Definition**:
  Let $X$ be a random variable that can take on one of $n$ distinct values, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, with each value having the same probability of occurring. Then $X$ is said to be a Uniform discrete random variable.

  The probability mass function (PMF) of $X$ is given by
  $
  p(X = x_i) = \frac{1}{n}, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n
  $

  - **Notation**: 
  $
  X \sim \text{Unif}(a,b)
  $
  where:
    - $X$ is a random variable following the discrete uniform distribution.
    - $a$ represents the minimum value of distinct possible values that the random variable X can take.
    - $b$ represents the maximum value of distinct possible values that the random variable X can take.

  - **Description**: In a discrete uniform distribution, every outcome is equally likely.  \
