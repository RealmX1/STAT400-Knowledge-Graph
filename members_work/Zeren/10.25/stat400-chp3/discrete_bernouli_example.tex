Let the outcome of the coin flip be denoted as a random variable \( X \). If the coin lands on heads, let \( X = 1 \). If the coin lands on tails, let \( X = 0 \). Assume that the probability of landing on heads (success) is \( p \), which could be, for instance, 0.5 for a fair coin. 

The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution can be expressed as:
\[
P(X = x) = 
\begin{cases} 
p & \text{if } x = 1 \\
1 - p & \text{if } x = 0 
\end{cases}
\]
