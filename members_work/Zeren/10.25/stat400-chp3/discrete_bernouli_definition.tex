Let \( X \) be a random variable that represents the outcome of a Bernoulli trial. Then \( X \) is said to be a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \( p \), where \( p \) is the probability of success (i.e., the probability that \( X = 1 \)) and \( 1 - p \) is the probability of failure (i.e., the probability that \( X = 0 \)). 

The PMF of such a Bernoulli random variable is given by
\[
P(X = x) = 
\begin{cases} 
p & \text{if } x = 1 \\
1 - p & \text{if } x = 0 
\end{cases}
\]
