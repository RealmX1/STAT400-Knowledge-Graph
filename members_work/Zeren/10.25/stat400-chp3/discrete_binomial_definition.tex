Suppose now that \( n \) independent trials, each of which results in a probability \( p \) of success and \( 1 - p \) of failure. Then \( X \) is said to be a binomial random variable with parameter \( (n, p) \) if \( X \) represents the number of successes that occurred in \( n \) trials.

The PMF of such a binomial random variable is given by
\[
p(X = i) = \binom{n}{i} p^i (1 - p)^{n - i}, \quad i = 0, 1, \ldots, n.
\]
