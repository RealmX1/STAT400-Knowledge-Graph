Let \( X \) be a random variable representing the number of successes in a sample of size \( n \) drawn without replacement from a population of size \( N \) that contains \( m \) successes. Then \( X \) is said to be a Hypergeometric random variable with parameters \( N \) (the population size), \( m \) (the number of successes in the population), and \( n \) (the sample size).

The PMF of such a Hypergeometric random variable is given by
\[
p(x = i) = \frac{\binom{m}{i} \binom{N - m}{n - i}}{\binom{N}{n}}, \quad i = 0, 1, \ldots, n.
