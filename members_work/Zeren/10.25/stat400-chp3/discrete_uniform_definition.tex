Let \( X \) be a random variable that can take on one of \( n \) distinct values, \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \), with each value having the same probability of occurring. Then \( X \) is said to be a Uniform discrete random variable.

The probability mass function (PMF) of \( X \) is given by
\[
p(X = x_i) = \frac{1}{n}, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n
\]
