given a gorund truth knowledge graph, 
1. have AI generate curicullum that teach the knowledge in different order.
2. For each curicullum:
   1. have an AI imitation of human learner who go through the knowledge according to the curicullum, and analyze the difficulty of capturing all knowledge into knowledge graph.
   2. Compare the final KG generated by AI learner with the ground truth KG. Axis of comparison include but not limited to:
      1. % of knowledge captured
      2. % of relations captured
      3. % of nodes in the chapter are correctly captured
      4. % of correct essential properties are captured
      5. % of correct essential relations are captured
      6. % of correct essential theorems used in the chapter are captured
      7. % of correct essential exercise problems are captured
      8. % of correct essential application examples are captured
   3. Log this together with the previously analyzed difficulty of capturing knowledge for comparison between different curicullums.


Doesn't have to be limited to a single course. This research can be extended to formulate better path for meta-learning of different knowledge fields given some set objective. For a career....
