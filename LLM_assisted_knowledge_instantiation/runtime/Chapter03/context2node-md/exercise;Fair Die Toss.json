    "attributes": "- **Name**: Fair Die Toss\n\n- **Problem Statement**: \n  Consider a fair die with six faces numbered from 1 to 6. You are to toss the die once. Determine the probability that you get an odd number.\n\n  - **Notation**: \n    \\( P(\\text{odd}) \\) $P(\\text{odd}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n- **Solution**: \n  Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). The numbers that are odd are 1, 3, and 5. Hence, there are three favorable outcomes out of six possible outcomes.\n\n  - **Step-by-Step Explanation**:\n    1. Identify the set of outcomes that are odd: \\(\\{1, 3, 5\\}\\).\n    2. Count the number of favorable outcomes: 3.\n    3. Calculate probability: \\( P(\\text{odd}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n- **Hints**: \n  - Recall that a fair die means all outcomes are equally likely.\n  - Consider only the outcomes that meet the condition of being odd.\n\n- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner\n\n- **Knowledge**: \n  *A fair die has equal likelihood for each outcome.*"
