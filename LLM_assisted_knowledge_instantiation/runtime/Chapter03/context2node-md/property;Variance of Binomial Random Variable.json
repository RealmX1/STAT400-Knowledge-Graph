    "attributes": "- **Name**: Variance of Binomial Random Variable\n  - **Aliases**: [\"Variance of Binomial Distribution\", \"Var(Binomial)\"]\n\n- **Definition**:\n  - **Notation**: \n    - Latex: `V(Binom(n, p)) = np(1-p)`\n    - Rendered: $V(Binom(n, p)) = np(1-p)$\n    - **Range**: $V(Binom(n, p)) \\in [0, n]$\n\n- **Description**: \n  The variance of a binomial random variable expresses the spread or variability of the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials. It is a measure of how much the number of successes deviates from the expected value over repeated experiments.\n\n- **Proof**: \n  The variance of a binomial distribution can be derived by using the formula for variance of a sum of independent random variables. Each trial in the binomial distribution is independent, and the trials can be considered as Bernoulli trials with variance $p(1-p)$. The variance of the binomial distribution is $np(1-p)$ since it is the sum of variances from these $n$ independent trials.\n  > NEED TO mark SOURCE for the information used here.
