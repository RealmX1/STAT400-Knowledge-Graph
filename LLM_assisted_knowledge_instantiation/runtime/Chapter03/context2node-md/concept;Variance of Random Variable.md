# Variance of Random Variable

## Attributes

- **Name**: Variance of Random Variable
  - **Aliases**: 
    - None
- **Definition**:
  - **Notation**:
    - Rendered: $V(X)$
    - Latex: `V(X)`
  - **Explanation**:
    - $X$
      - Description: Represents a random variable.
    - $V(X)$
      - Description: Represents the variance of the random variable $X$.
- **Example**:
  - $$V(X) = \frac{(N+1)(N-1)}{12}$$ for a uniform discrete random variable $X$ on $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.
    - Description: For a random variable $X$ with a uniform discrete distribution, the variance can be calculated according to the given expression. 
- **Description**:
  - Variance measures the spread or variability of a random variable around its expected value (mean). It is a crucial component in statistics to understand the distribution characteristics of a random variable, particularly how dispersed the outcomes are likely to be.
