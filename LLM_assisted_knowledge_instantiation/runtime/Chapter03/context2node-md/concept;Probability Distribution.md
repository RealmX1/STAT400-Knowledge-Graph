# Concept Node: Probability Distribution

## Attributes

- **Name**: Probability Distribution
  - **Aliases**: 
    - Distribution Function
    - Distribution Function of a Random Variable

- **Definition**:
  - **Notation**: $P(X=x)$
    - Symbols or mathematical notations associated with the concept. First present raw latex code, then present the rendered latex code.
    - Latex: `P(X=x)`
    - Rendered: $P(X=x)$
  - **Explanation**:
    - $X$
      - Description: Represents a random variable.
    - $x$
      - Description: Represents a particular value that a random variable $X$ can take on.
    - $P(X=x)$
      - Description: Represents the probability that the random variable $X$ takes the value $x$.
  - **Example**:
    - $$p_X(x) = P(X=x)$$
      - Description: An example of a probability distribution, showing how probability is assigned to values of a random variable.

- **Description**: 
  - Probability distribution describes how probabilities are assigned to values of a random variable. It is a fundamental concept in statistics and is used to model the behavior of random phenomena.
