It captures the average outcome in terms of success count in simple random sampling from a finite population.\n\n- **Proof**: \n  > NEED TO mark SOURCE for the information used here. By default we will use `Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez`\n  *Proof*: \n  The expectation of a Hypergeometric random variable can be derived using the linearity of expectation and considering it as a sum of indicators for success in each of the $n$ draws. Each draw has a probability of success $\\frac{M}{N}$. Hence, the expected number of successes is the product of the number of draws and the probability of success in each draw: \n  \\[\n  E(X) = n \\cdot \\frac{M}{N}\n  \\]"
