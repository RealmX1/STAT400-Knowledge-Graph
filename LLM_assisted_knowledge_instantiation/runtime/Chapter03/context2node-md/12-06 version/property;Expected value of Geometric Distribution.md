# Expected value of Geometric Distribution

## Attributes

- **Name**: Expected value of Geometric Distribution
  - **Aliases**: ["Mean of Geometric Distribution", "Expectation of Geometric Distribution"]

- **Definition**: 
  - **Notation**:
    - Latex: `E[Geom(p)] = \frac{1}{p}` 
    - Rendered: $E[Geom(p)] = \frac{1}{p}$
    - **Range**: $(0, \infty)$

- **Description**: 
  The expected value of a Geometric Distribution represents the average number of trials required to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a success probability of $p$.

- **Proof**: 
  *The proof is based on the calculation of the infinite series for the expectation of geometric random variables, which converges to 1/p. The summary of steps include showing the series derivation and its convergence.*
