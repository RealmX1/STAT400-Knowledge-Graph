# Property Node

## Attributes

- **Name**: Expected value of Hypergeometric Distribution
  - **Aliases**: ["Expected Value", "Mean of Hypergeometric Distribution"]

- **Definition**: 
  - **Notation**: 
    - Latex: `E[Hyper(N, M, n)] = \frac{nM}{N}`
    - Rendered: $E[Hyper(N, M, n)] = \frac{nM}{N}$

    - **Range**: 
      - Latex: `E[Hyper(N, M, n)] \in \{0, n\}`
      - Rendered: $E[Hyper(N, M, n)] \in \{0, n\}$

- **Description**: Expected value of Hypergeometric Distribution represents the average number of successes in a fixed number of draws without replacement. It is determined by the ratio of total successes in the population and the population size, multiplied by the number of draws.

- **Proof**:
