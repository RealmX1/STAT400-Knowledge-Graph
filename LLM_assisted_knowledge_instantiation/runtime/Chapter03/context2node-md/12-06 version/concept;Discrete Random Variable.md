# Discrete Random Variable

## Attributes

- **Name**: Discrete Random Variable
  - **Aliases**: 
    - Discrete RV

- **Definition**:
  - **Notation**: $X$
  - **Explanation**:
    - $X$:
      - Description: Represents a discrete random variable , which is a function that maps each outcome of a random experiment to a real number.
