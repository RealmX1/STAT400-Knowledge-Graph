## Concept Node: Bernoulli Trial

### Attributes

- **Name**: *Bernoulli Trial*
  - **Aliases**: 
    - Bernoulli experiment
    - Binary trial

- **Definition**:
  - **Notation**: 
  - **Explanation**: 
    - A Bernoulli trial is an experiment that results in exactly one of two positive outcomes, "success" or "failure."
  - **Example**:
    - *Example 1*: Flipping a coin is a classic example where the outcomes are "heads" (success) or "tails" (failure).
    - *Example 2*: Checking if a light bulb works (success) or does not work (failure), where the success probability is denoted by \( p \) and failure by \( 1-p \).
  
- **Description**: 
  - A Bernoulli trial is the simplest type of random experiment. It serves as a foundational concept for several discrete distributions—including the Bernoulli distribution and the Binomial distribution—by modeling binary outcomes.

### Relationships

- **is_subconcept_of** -> *Concept* [Discrete Distribution]
  - The Bernoulli trial is a foundational concept beneath discrete distributions as it tests for dichotomous outcomes, integral to understanding distributions with binary results.

- **is_prerequisite_of** → *Concept* [Bernoulli Distribution, Binomial Distribution, Geometric Distribution, Negative Binomial Distribution]
  - Understanding a Bernoulli trial is essential for comprehending the nature and properties of distributions that involve binary trials.
