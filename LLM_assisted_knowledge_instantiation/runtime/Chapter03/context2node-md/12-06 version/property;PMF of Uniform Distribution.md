# PMF of Uniform Distribution

## Attributes

- **Name**: PMF of Uniform Distribution

- **Definition**: 
  - **Notation**: 
    - \( p_X(x) = \frac{1}{N} \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{X} \)
    - $p_X(x) = \frac{1}{N} \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{X}$
    - **Range**: \( N \in \mathbb{N} \)

- **Description**: 
  - The probability mass function (PMF) of a uniform discrete distribution describes a scenario where each of the possible outcomes is equally likely. The range of the variable \( X \) with a uniform discrete distribution is a finite set defined as \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, N\}\), and each outcome has a probability of \(\frac{1}{N}\).

- **Proof**: 
  - In this context, the PMF is verified by considering the definition of a discrete uniform distribution where each outcome in the sample space \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, N\}\) has an equal probability of being realized, computed as \(\frac{1}{N}\).
