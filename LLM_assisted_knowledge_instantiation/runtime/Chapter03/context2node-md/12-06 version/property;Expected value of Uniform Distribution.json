For a Uniform distribution over a range {1, 2, ..., N}, the expected value can be interpreted graphically as the midpoint of this range.\n\n- **Proof**: *Source: Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez*\n  - When \\(X\\) is uniformly distributed on {1, 2, ..., N}, the expected value is derived by summing all values in the range and dividing by the number of values. Calculating \\(E(X) = \\frac{1 + 2 + ... + N}{N}\\), we can use the formula for the sum of the first N natural numbers: \\(\\frac{N(N+1)}{2}\\). This gives us \\(\\frac{N+1}{2}\\)."
