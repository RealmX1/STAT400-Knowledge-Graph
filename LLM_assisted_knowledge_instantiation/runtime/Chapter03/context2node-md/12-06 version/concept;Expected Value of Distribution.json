It is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.\n  - **Example**:\n    - $$E(X) = \\frac{N+1}{2}$$\n      - Description: This is the expected value for a Uniform Discrete Distribution on the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$.\n\n- **Description**: \n  - The expected value, often called the mean, of a distribution is a measure of the \"center\" of the probability distribution. For discrete random variables, it is calculated as the sum of the products of the probabilities and their corresponding values."
