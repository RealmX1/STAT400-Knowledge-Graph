    "attributes": "- **Name**: Defective Widgets from Production Line\n\n- **Problem Statement**:\n  Imagine you are working at a factory that produces widgets. In a batch of 50 widgets, 10 are defective, and 40 are not. You randomly select 5 widgets for a quality check. You are interested in finding the probability that exactly 2 of the 5 widgets you selected are defective.\n  - **Notation**: PMF, probability\n\n- **Solution**:\n\n  Here:\n  $\n  \\text{Population size } N = 50, \\quad n = 5, \\quad m = 10.\n  $\n\n  Based on the distribution of a Hypergeometric random variable,\n  $\n  p(x = 2) = \\frac{\\binom{10}{2} \\binom{50 - 10}{5 - 2}}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{\\binom{10}{2} \\binom{40}{3}}{\\binom{50}{5}} = 0.21.\n  $\n\n- **Difficulty Level**: 1/5\n\n> From `Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez`"
