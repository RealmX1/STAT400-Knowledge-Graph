# Variance of Uniform Distribution

## Attributes

- **Name**: Variance of Uniform Distribution
  - **Aliases**: ["Variance", "Spread of Uniform Distribution"]

- **Definition**: 
  - **Notation**: 
    - LaTeX: `V(X) = \frac{(N+1)(N-1)}{12}`
    - Rendered: \(V(X) = \frac{(N+1)(N-1)}{12}\)

- **Description**: 
  - The variance of a Uniform Discrete Distribution on the set \(\{1, 2, 3, \dots, N\}\) measures the dispersion of the possible values around the mean. It quantifies how much the values differ from the expected value.
  
- **Proof**: 
  - Source: Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez
  - *Provide proof using typical methods for calculating variance of uniform discrete distributions over integer ranges.*
