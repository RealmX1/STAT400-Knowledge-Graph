If the coin lands on tails, let $X = 0$. Assume that the probability of landing on heads (success) is $p$, which could be, for instance, 0.5 for a fair coin. Compute PMF of $X$\n  - **Notation**: PMF\n\n- **Solution**:\n  The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution can be expressed as:\n  $\n  P(X = x) = \n  \\begin{cases} \n  p & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n  1 - p & \\text{if } x = 0 \n  \\end{cases}\n  $\n\n- **Difficulty Level**: 1/5\n\n> From `Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez`"
