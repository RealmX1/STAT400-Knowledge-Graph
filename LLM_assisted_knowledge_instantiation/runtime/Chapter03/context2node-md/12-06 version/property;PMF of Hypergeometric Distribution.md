# Property Node: PMF of Hypergeometric Distribution

## Attributes

- **Name**: PMF of Hypergeometric Distribution

- **Definition**: 
  - **Notation**: 
    - Latex: `p_X(x) = \frac{{N \choose x} {N-M \choose n-x}}{{N \choose n}}`
    - Rendered: $p_X(x) = \frac{{N \choose x} {N-M \choose n-x}}{{N \choose n}}$ 
    - **Range**: 
      - Latex: $x \in \{0,1, 2, 3, \dots, \min(n, M)\}$
      - Rendered: $x \in \{0,1, 2, 3, \dots, \min(n, M)\}$

- **Description**: 
  The probability mass function (PMF) of the Hypergeometric Distribution, which calculates the probability of obtaining exactly x successes in a sample of size n drawn without replacement from a finite population of size N containing M successes.

- **Proof**: *Not provided in the context.*
