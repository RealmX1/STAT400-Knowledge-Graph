The range of the variable \\( X \\) with a uniform discrete distribution is a finite set defined as \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}\\), and each outcome has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\).\n\n- **Proof**: \n  - In this context, the PMF is verified by considering the definition of a discrete uniform distribution where each outcome in the sample space \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, N\\}\\) has an equal probability of being realized, computed as \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\). \n  > SOURCE: Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez"
