## Attributes

- **Name**: PMF of Geometric Distribution
  - **Aliases**: 
    - Probability Mass Function of Geometric Distribution

- **Definition**: 
  - **Notation**: 
    - Latex: `p_X(x) = p^x(1-p)^{(x-1)}`
    - Rendered: $p_X(x) = p^x(1-p)^{(x-1)}$
  - **Range**: $x \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} = \mathbb{N}$

- **Description**: 
  - The probability mass function (PMF) of a Geometric Distribution describes the probability of a successful trial occurring on the $x^{th}$ attempt in a sequence of independent trials, where each trial has the same probability of success $p$. 
  - It is used in scenarios where the number of trials is counted until the first success is observed.
