## Attributes

- **Name**: Discrete Distribution
  - **Aliases**: 
    - Discrete Probability Distribution

- **Description**: 
  - A discrete distribution is a probability distribution that can take on a countable number of values. In the case of a discrete random variable, the set of values $X$ can take, denoted as $\mathcal{X}$, is a discrete subset of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ without limit points (a **limit point** within a topological space is a point \( x \) such that every neighborhood around \( x \) contains at least one point from \( S \) distinct from \( x \) itself. This means that points from \( S \) can be found arbitrarily close to \( x \), regardless of whether \( x \) is an element of \( S \)). Discrete distributions have a probability mass function (PMF) assigning probabilities to each possible value.
