  - A discrete distribution represents a type of probability distribution where the set of possible outcomes is discrete, or countable. In other words, the random variable associated with a discrete distribution can take on a finite or countably infinite set of values. Discrete distributions are characterized by a probability mass function, which assigns a probability to each potential outcome.
