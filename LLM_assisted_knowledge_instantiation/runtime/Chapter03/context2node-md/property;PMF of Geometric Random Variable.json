    "attributes": "- **Name**: PMF of Geometric Distribution\n  - **Aliases**: Probability Mass Function of Geometric Distribution\n\n- **Definition**: \n  - **Notation**:\n    - Latex: `p_X(x) = p^x(1-p)^{(x-1)}`\n    - Rendered: $p_X(x) = p^x(1-p)^{(x-1)}$\n    - **Range**: $x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$\n\n- **Description**: \n  The PMF of a Geometric distribution represents the probability of observing the first success on the $x$th trial in a series of independent Bernoulli trials, each of which has a probability of success $p$. The distribution models waiting times until the first success.\n\n- **Proof**: \n  The proof involves calculating the probability that the first $x-1$ trials are failures and the $x$-th trial is a success. Hence, the probability is given by $p_X(x) = (1-p)^{x-1}p$. This can be shown by considering the sample space for the geometric experiment, which involves independent Bernoulli trials, with trials succeeding after $x-1$ failures. \n  > SOURCE: Stat400 teaching material - Jonathan Fernandez"
