It depends on the probability of success \\(p\\).\n\n- **Proof**: \n  To find the expected value, consider the series of Bernoulli trials where the first success comes with probability \\(p\\) on the \\(k\\)-th trial. Therefore, the probability of failure in the previous trials is \\((1-p)^{k-1}\\).\n  Using the equation for expected value of a random variable, and solving the geometric series, we obtain the expected value as \\(\\frac{1}{p}\\)."
