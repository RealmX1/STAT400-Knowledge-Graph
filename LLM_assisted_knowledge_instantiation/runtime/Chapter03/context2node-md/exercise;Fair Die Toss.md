# Fair Die Toss

## Attributes

- **Name**: Fair Die Toss

- **Problem Statement**: 
  Consider a fair die with six faces numbered from 1 to 6. You are to toss the die once. Determine the probability that you get an odd number.

  - **Notation**: 
    \( P(\text{odd}) \) $P(\text{odd}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$

- **Solution**: 
  Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of \( \frac{1}{6} \). The numbers that are odd are 1, 3, and 5. Hence, there are three favorable outcomes out of six possible outcomes.

  - **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1. Identify the set of outcomes that are odd: \(\{1, 3, 5\}\).
    2. Count the number of favorable outcomes: 3.
    3. Calculate probability: \( P(\text{odd}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

- **Hints**: 
  - Recall that a fair die means all outcomes are equally likely.
  - Consider only the outcomes that meet the condition of being odd.

- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner

- **Knowledge**: 
  *A fair die has equal likelihood for each outcome.*
