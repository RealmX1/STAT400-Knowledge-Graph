\section*{Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose we count the number of emails received in a given hour. If emails arrive at a constant average rate, the number of emails received in one hour can be modeled by \( X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda) \), where
    \[
    \lambda = \text{the average number of emails received per hour}.
    \]
    In this setting, \( p_X(k) = P(X = k) \), is the probability of receiving exactly \( k \) emails in one hour.

    \item Suppose we observe the number of calls received by a customer support center in a given day. If the calls come in at a constant average rate, this experiment can be modeled by \( X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda) \), where
    \[
    \lambda = \text{the average number of calls per day}.
    \]
    In this setting, \( p_X(k) = P(X = k) \), is the probability of receiving exactly \( k \) calls in one day.

    \item Suppose we are counting the number of accidents occurring at a particular intersection in a month. If accidents occur at a known constant average rate, this can be modeled by \( X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda) \), where
    \[
    \lambda = \text{the average number of accidents per month}.
    \]
    In this setting, \( p_X(k) = P(X = k) \), is the probability of observing exactly \( k \) accidents in a month.
