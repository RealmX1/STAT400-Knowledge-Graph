You will be provided with the complete content of a chapter, descriptions of different node types, and the list of existing `node type;node name` pairs in the knowledge graph. Based on this information, your task is to generate a list of new `node type;node name` pairs that should be added to the knowledge graph for this chapter.
You should not use what the context say as "theorem" for reference of generating theorem nodes.

- Carefully analyze the content of the chapter and consider how different concepts can be represented as nodes in the graph.
- Use the node types provided to classify each new node.
- Ensure that none of the new nodes already exist in the graph by cross-referencing the provided list of existing nodes.
- Present the output as a list of `node type;node name` pairs.

**Input:**
- **Node Type Descriptions:**  
  <node_type_description> 
  </node_type_description> 
- **Chapter Content:**  
  <context> 
  </context>  
- **Existing `node type;node name` Pairs in the Graph:**  
  <existing_nodes> 
  </existing_nodes>

**Output:**  
an array of new nodes (including their type and name) to add to the graph for that chapter.
