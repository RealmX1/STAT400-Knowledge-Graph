Since the stat400 concept .tex files are pretty well structured, what @Zeren Li previously suggested of, "creating main branch mannually" can actually also be done algorithmically.

The structure that the file follows is:

\chapter[Chapter Name]{Chapter Name}
\section{Section Name}

\begin{defn}
Definition Block
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
Example Block
\end{ex}

\begin{thm}
Theorem Block
\end{thm}

\section{Section Name2}
...
