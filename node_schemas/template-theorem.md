In mathematics, a theorem is typically composed of the following elements:

1. **Statement**: A precise, formal declaration of the proposition, usually conditional, stating a relationship between premises and conclusion.
2. **Hypotheses or Assumptions**: The conditions under which the theorem holds.
3. **Proof**: A logical argument establishing the truth of the theorem from the hypotheses and previously established statements, such as axioms and other theorems.

The line "any alpha-sublevel set of a convex function is still convex" can be considered a theorem if it has been rigorously proved based on mathematical principles. To decompose it:

- **Statement**: The alpha-sublevel set of a convex function is convex.
- **Hypotheses**: The function in question is convex; the alpha-sublevel set is defined for a particular value of alpha.
- **Proof**: Would need to demonstrate that for any two points within the alpha-sublevel set, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the set, leveraging the definition of convexity of the function and the sublevel set.

This decomposition aligns with the structure of a mathematical theorem.
