Follow schema in `node_schemas/md_schemas/` to create your own nodes for yoru selected chapter/section from Stat400_Concepts (I'd recommend uploading the concept folder to overleaf)

Example of how to instantiate node according to schema is in `node_schemas/md_schemas/examples.md`. Don't rely on it too much as it is generated by GPT.

Your work should be saved at `node_schemas/1st_attempt_nodes/` folder.
Create one `.md` file for each node. Name it as `"{concept/property/theorem}_{name}.md"`, where name is connected with `-`. 
Optionally mark chapter and section at beginning of the file if you can in the following format (optional):
```md
Chapter{num}:{Chapter Title (not connected with hyphen)}
Section{num}:{Section Title (not connected with hyphen)}
```
If you want to make modification to the schema, do it at the end of the following google doc; Remember to check this file before starting your work each time to gain insite on other people's modification:
